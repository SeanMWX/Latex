\subsection{Summary}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item One summer was not enough to shape AI -> but many significant advances have been made since!
    \item Movie AI, News AI and Research AI differ
    \item Modern AI systems combine 'reasoning' with 'learning' -> this course: 'resoning' focus
    \item Much to say about ethics and fairness of AI systems
\end{enumerate}
